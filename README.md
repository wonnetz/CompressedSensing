# CompressedSensing
Compressed sensing (compressive sensing) is a signal processing technique that efficiently acquires and reconstructs a signal, by finding solutions to an undertermined system of linear equations. This is usually represented in the form Ax = b. Here, x is our input signal and b is the signal that we wish to reconstruct. There are two conditions under which recovery of the signal possible. The first one is sparsity, which means the vector interpretation of the signal is mostly filled with zeros.  The second one is incoherence, which describes the relationship between the input signal and the output signal. For the best reconstruction of the output signal, we would like for the input signal to be as sparse and coherent as possible.
